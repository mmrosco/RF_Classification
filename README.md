# RF_Classification
This script was developed to classify satellite images. The first functions are to faciliate working with raster files (coordinate conversion, clipping) and to convert DN number to TOA and surface reflectance values. The next function splits a shapefile with training data into test and trainig data and saves each set into a raster with to be used in the classification process. There is two classification functions, one with hyperparameter optimisation using GridSearch and one without. 

This is part of a NESSC funded project at the VU Amsterdam.
